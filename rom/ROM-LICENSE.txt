ROM Image Licensing
====================

The ROM images in this directory are NOT covered by the project's GPLv2
license.  They are proprietary firmware redistributed with permission (or,
in the case of MF2.rom, under community practice).


Amstrad CPC ROMs
-----------------
Files: cpc464.rom, cpc664.rom, cpc6128.rom, amsdos.rom, system.cpr

(c) Amstrad plc and Locomotive Software Ltd.

The operating-system and BASIC firmware was written by Locomotive Software.
Amstrad hold the copyright on the ROM images as shipped in CPC hardware.

Amstrad have kindly given their permission for the redistribution of their
copyrighted material but retain that copyright.

This permission was announced by Cliff Lawson (Amstrad) in 1999 on the
comp.sys.amstrad.8bit Usenet newsgroup.  Locomotive Software separately
confirmed permission for redistribution via Richard Clayton.

These files may be freely redistributed with CPC emulators, but they remain
the copyrighted property of Amstrad plc and Locomotive Software Ltd.  They
are NOT licensed under GPLv2 or any open-source license.


Multiface II ROM
-----------------
File: MF2.rom

(c) Romantic Robot Ltd.

Romantic Robot Ltd was dissolved in August 2025 (UK Companies House).  No
explicit redistribution permission was granted by Romantic Robot prior to
dissolution.  The copyright is now orphaned — it still exists, but there is
no known entity authorised to grant or deny redistribution rights.

MF2.rom is included for compatibility with upstream Caprice32 and in line
with the broader CPC emulation community practice of distributing this ROM.
Multiface II support in konCePCja is experimental.  Users may substitute
their own Multiface II ROM image if they prefer.
